(*
  Put all helper functions needed for keywordcount here. Helper functions should be tested, and
  they go in this file so that they are testable. If they are only in keywordcount.ml,
  which compiles to an executable, then they are not accessible from a test file.

  Feel free to remove `placeholder` when you add your actual functions.
